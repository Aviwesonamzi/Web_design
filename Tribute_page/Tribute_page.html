            <p>Dr. Jane Goodall is a British primatologist and anthropologist. She is considered to be the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, having studied the social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania, for over 60 years. Her groundbreaking research has transformed the understanding of chimpanzees, humanity's closest living relatives, and has made her one of the most respected and iconic figures in the fields of primatology, ethology, and conservation.</p>
